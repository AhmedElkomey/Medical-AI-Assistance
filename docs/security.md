# Security Considerations

## HIPAA Compliance
 - All PHI must be encrypted using secure methods
 - Data should be anonymized before storage or processing

## Encryption
 - Use strong encryption keys (Fernet symmetric encryption)
 - Store encryption keys securely (environment variables or secrets manager)

## Access Control
 - Limit access to sensitive data and endpoints
 - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms

## Logging
 - Ensure that logs do not contain PHI or sensitive information
 - Use secure logging practices

## Network Security
 - Use HTTPS for all network communications
 - Secure API endpoints and web interfaces
